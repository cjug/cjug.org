            The CJUG became involved in the Adopt-a-JSR program in 2014, when we officially adopted JSR 366, the Java Platform, Enterprise
            Edition 8 Umbrella specification. The Adopt-a-JSR program is led by the Java Community Process (JCP), with a goal of getting
            JUGs more involved with the Java specifications process. During our tenure as Adopt-a-JSR participants, we have held a number
            of sessions in person and online, in an effort to help foster each of the different JSRs that came together to comprise
            Java EE 8 and Java SE 9.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since Java EE 8 and Java SE 9 have been released to the general public, CJUG is taking a more broad approach to open source.
            We are still supporting the Adopt-a-JSR program, but we are also supporting other open source initiatives, such as projects
            from Apache, the Eclipse Foundation, and others. OSS @ CJUG is an initiative to get the Chicago Java Community more involved
            in open source.
