    <h3>Sponsors What to expect?</h3>
    <p>
        When you arrive make sure you get a Red “Sponsor” name id badge to identify yourself to Attendee’s as a Sponsor.
        CJUG Board members will be wearing name badges to identify them, so feel free to ask them for help.
        Generally the meetings start about 20 to 30 minutes after published start time.
        Initially a Master Of Ceremonies (generally a CJUG Board Member) will kick off the event.
        Announcements of CJUG related information and other CJUG information will be communicated.
        Sponsors are announced to crowd, its very important to stand up so everyone sees you and knows
        who to talk to about your company/product/service if they have questions.
        The Master of Ceremonies will introduce Premium level sponsors (Silver and up) and they are generally
        allowed to conduct a brief 10 minute presentation if they desire it.
        The presentation generally will take about a hour, at the end, some closing remarks will occur and if
        post-event drinks are available, it will be announced where to go.
    </p>
    <p>
        You <b>can</b> help during the pre-presentation period by passing out “Meeting Attendee” badges to attendees.
        This will allow you to talk to prospective attendee’s and also figure out if they are “interested in
        new opportunities” since you will remind them to check that box if they are interested.
        It is acceptable for a paid sponsor to pass them a business card at this time, however we ask that
        it be kept informal and attempt to avoid the awkward uncomfortable interview questions at that time.
        Ask any CJUG Board member for the badges and pens and feel free to walk arround and ask attendees to fill them
        out.
        Of course feel free to get some food and drinks, but consider waiting till all the attendee’s are ‘badged’.
        Relax during the presentation, or grab some food then, it might be kinda boring for non-technies, but its only a
        hour.
    </p>
    <p>
        CJUG operates on a “Sponsor Paid Model”, meaning we rely on Sponsors to fund the non-profit activities, which
        amount to over $ 1,000 per meeting. This model, chosen by Board Members and Attendees, requires that we charge
        for sponsor attendance. Sponsors have made it very clear, they will only pay if we prevent “free loaders” from
        attending and doing sponsor activities without paying. Non-paying sponsors attempting any sponsor like activity
        (example: recruiting) will be asked to leave, if you see any issues, please point them out to a Board Member
        and we can have security escort them out.

        Post-Event Drinks<br/>
        The post-event drinks period generally only gets about 20% to 40% of the events attendee’s due to interest,
        time, and travel issues. All paid sponsors are welcome to attend the post-event activities. The post event
        activities should not last more than a hour. This is a great opportunity to meet attendees and network.

    <h3>Post-event Socializing Sponsorship</h3>
    <p>
        Post event Socializing Sponsorship is paid directly from your company to the local public bar that we select.
        This expense is in addition to the “post event fee” that CJUG charges. It should be anywhere from $50 to $250
        (you should pre-choose what you think is your maximum), and best of all it can be processed via your normal
        employee meals and entertainment reimbursable expenses – there is no fee paid to CJUG only to the bar for this.
        Please carefully understand the obligations, they are designed to allow a lower cost function only when they are
        adhered to, instruct your staff to not go beyond them. Obligations will be to have CJUG people come only to your
        designated staff to meet them, and give them a dollar for a discounted drink (the dollar plus having it at a
        public bar assists with legal liability issues associated with “free” drinks) of one tap beer (or if you want a
        bottle beer) you select, or 1 white/red house wine you select brand/price. Do not allow any other items or
        expenses will skyrocket and expose you to additional potential liabilities. The drinks are offered at YOUR sole
        discretion (aka, when U go past the money you allocate, that’s the end of the drinks, period – someone misses a
        drink, oh, well theirs the bar, go buy your own). CJUG requires not buying multiple “rounds” of drinks, but some
        sponsors find that its ok provided they stick to their pre-chosen budget and a allow 2 drinks. Keep the focus on
        meeting people and building connections. We avoid paying extra bar fees, by not reserving a room, and by
        channeling all orders thru your designated staff who will wear “sponsor” name tags we provide.
