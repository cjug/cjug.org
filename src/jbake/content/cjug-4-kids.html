                Hak4Kidz is an event of ethical hackers and Information Security professionals dedicated to bring the educational and communal benefits of white hat hacking conferences to children and young adults. We accomplish this mission by putting our collective expertise and passion on display for the attendees to interact with us at their will. A combination of activity stations and detailed workshops will enable the attendees to expand and enlighten their technical interests. For innovation to perpetuate, it’s imperative that today’s young users are exposed to the bigger picture of how we got here and to help realize their potential.
