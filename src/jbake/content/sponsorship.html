            One goal of the CJUG is to allow developers to meet, discuss and learn from our regularly scheduled
            presentations. These meetings are a fantastic opportunity to connect or network with recruiters and the
            Chicago tech industry, if one is so inclined. Benefits of this symbiotic relationship between developers and
            recruiters includes career opportunities, different event hosting locations, raffles, freebies and
            discounts. Many years ago CJUG relied on membership fees to cover a minimal set of expenses. With
            anticipated growth from a events for the developer community, including the ability to invite guest speakers
            from outside of Chicago.

            If you are a Java professional you should expect to see more benefits from future CJUG activities and the
            quality of our presentation events. There will be “rules of engagement” between our paying sponsors and you
            as a member, in general we don’t want members to be overwhelmed by sponsors, so we try to make attendance to
            this portion of the event separate and optional.
        </p>

            If you are interested in becoming a sponsor we are offering multiple levels of privileges (shared or
            exclusive) such as speaking or presenting briefly at a meeting, emailing the user list, hosting
            opportunities and other advertising or marketing opportunities through CJUG. Note that this means we are
            closing the “free” channels of advertising such as the now disabled chicago-java-advertise@yahoogroups.com,
            Jobs and Promotions on the LinkedIn group, etc. Please see below for pricing and contact us through the
            http://cjug.org web site or email cjug@cjug.org.
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on feedback from our members, attendees, and sponsors, they have asked us to eliminate any sponsor
            attendee’s that are not paid sponsors. Thus we have a policy of not allowing non-paid sponsors to attend,
            they will be asked to leave.
