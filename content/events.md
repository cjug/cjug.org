![Duke needs you](/images/duke_needs_you.jpeg)

The CJUG became involved in the Adopt-a-JSR program in 2014, when we officially adopted JSR 366, the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 8 Umbrella specification. The Adopt-a-JSR program is led by the Java Community Process (JCP), with a goal of getting JUGs more involved with the Java specifications process. During our tenure as Adopt-a-JSR participants, we have held a number of sessions in person and online, in an effort to help foster each of the different JSRs that came together to comprise Java EE 8 and Java SE 9.

Since Java EE 8 and Java SE 9 have been released to the general public, CJUG is taking a more broad approach to open source. We are still supporting the Adopt-a-JSR program, but we are also supporting other open source initiatives, such as projects from Apache, the Eclipse Foundation, and others. OSS @ CJUG is an initiative to get the Chicago Java Community more involved in open source.
